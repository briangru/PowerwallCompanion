# Powerwall Companion
Powerwall Companion is a Windows UWP app for monitoring your Tesla Powerwall 2 battery. 
It has similar functionality to the official Tesla app for Android/iOS, but it's designed to be 
more of an "always on" dashboard. You may want to pick up a cheap Windows Phone on eBay and use
this app as a permanent monitor for your battery and solar system.

The app is available to download from the Windows Store [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/p/powerwall-companion/9n3m45c4zcj4). 
The store is the easiest way to get the app, but I'm sharing the source in case anyone wants to improve it or is curious about the underlying APIs.
There's also an Android version available! ([Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thirtyhippos.powerwallcompanionx) | [Source](https://github.com/tomhollander/PowerwallCompanionX))
